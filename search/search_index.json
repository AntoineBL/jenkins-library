You have installed Node.js including node and npm. See Node.js . Context \u00b6 In many SAP development scenarios, it is vital to synchronize both backend and frontend deliveries. These deliveries are typically an SAP UI5 application and an ABAP backend from which it is served. The SAP UI5 parts are often developed using agile practices and use Continuous Integration pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy the application. Note: This scenario description is an example. You can apply the process to other scenarios and component sets, as well. In this scenario, we want to show how an agile development process with Jenkins CI can automatically feed changes into SAP Solution Manager. In SAP Solution Manager, all parts of the application stack come together and can be subject to classic change and transport management. The basic workflow is as follows: The pipeline scans the Git commit messages for a line like ChangeDocument : <changeDocumentId> , and validates that the change is in the correct status in development . For more information, see checkChangeInDevelopment . An example for the commit message looks as follows: Fix terminology in documentation Terminology must be consistent with official channels. ChangeDocument: <Your Change Document ID> Note: The blank line between message header and message description is mandatory. To communicate with SAP Solution Manager, the pipeline uses credentials that must be stored on Jenkins using the credential ID CM . For more information, see checkChangeInDevelopment . The required transport request is created on the fly. Note: The change document can contain various components (for example, UI and backend components). The changes of your development team trigger the Jenkins pipeline. It builds and validates the changes and attaches them to the respective transport request. As soon as the development process is completed, the change document in SAP Solution Manager can be set to status to be tested and all components can be transported to the test system.

This allows the function to access the commonPipelineEnvironment for retrieving e.g. configuration parameters. artifactType defines the type of the artifact. buildTool defines the tool which is used for building the artifact. commitVersion controls if the changed version is committed and pushed to the git repository. If this is enabled (which is the default), you need to provide gitCredentialsId and gitSshUrl . dockerVersionSource specifies the source to be used for the main version which is used for generating the automatic version. This can either be the version of the base image - as retrieved from the FROM statement within the Dockerfile, e.g. FROM jenkins:2.46.2 Alternatively the name of an environment variable defined in the Docker image can be used which contains the version number, e.g. ENV MY_VERSION 1.2.3 The third option appVersion applies only to the artifactType appContainer . Here the version of the app which is packaged into the container will be used as version for the container itself. Using filePath you could define a custom path to the descriptor file. gitCommitId defines the version prefix of the automatically generated version. By default it will take the long commitId hash. You could pass any other string (e.g. the short commitId hash) to be used. In case you don't want to have the gitCommitId added to the automatic versioning string you could set the value to an empty string: '' . gitSshCredentialsId defines the ssh git credentials to be used for writing the tag. The parameters gitUserName and gitUserEMail allow to overwrite the global git settings available on your Jenkins server gitSshUrl defines the git ssh url to the source code repository. tagPrefix defines the prefix wich is used for the git tag which is written during the versioning run. timestamp defines the timestamp to be used in the automatic version string.

How to setup this monitoring is described in the following. You basically need three components: The InfluxDB Jenkins plugin which allows you to send build metrics to InfluxDB servers The InfluxDB to store this data (Docker available) A Grafana dashboard to visualize the data stored in InfluxDB (Docker available) no InfluxDB available? If you don't have an InfluxDB available yet this step will still provide you some benefit. It will create following files for you and archive them into your build: jenkins_data.json : This file gives you build-specific information, like e.g. build result, stage where the build failed influx_data.json : This file gives you detailed information about your pipeline, e.g. stage durations, steps executed, ... Prerequisites \u00b6 Setting up InfluxDB with Grafana \u00b6 The easiest way to start with is using the available official docker images. You can either run these docker containers on the same host on which you run your Jenkins or each docker on individual VMs (hosts). Very basic setup can be done like that (with user \"admin\" and password \"adminPwd\" for both InfluxDB and Grafana): docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -p 8086:8086 --restart=always --name influxdb -v /var/influx_data:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name grafana --restart=always --link influxdb:influxdb -e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminPwd\" grafana/grafana For more advanced setup please reach out to the respective documentation: https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/ (and https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/influxdb) https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana/ (and https://github.com/grafana/grafana-docker) After you have started your InfluxDB docker you need to create a database: in a Webbrowser open the InfluxDB Web-UI using the following URL: <host of your docker>:8083 (port 8083 is used for access via Web-UI, for Jenkins you use port 8086 to access the DB) create new DB (the name of this DB you need to provide later to Jenkins) create Admin user (this user you need to provide later to Jenkins) With InfluxDB version 1.1 the InfluxDB Web-UI is deprecated You can perform the above steps via commandline: The following command will create a database with name <databasename> curl -i -XPOST http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode \"q=CREATE DATABASE \\<databasename\\>\" The admin user with the name <adminusername> and the password <adminuserpwd> can be created with curl -i -XPOST http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode \"q=CREATE USER \\<adminusername\\> WITH PASSWORD '\\<adminuserpwd\\>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES\" Once you have started both docker containers and Influx and Grafana are running you need to configure the Jenkins Plugin according to your settings. Pipeline configuration \u00b6 To setup your Jenkins you need to do two configuration steps: Configure Jenkins (via Manage Jenkins) Adapt pipeline configuration Configure Jenkins \u00b6 Once the plugin is available in your Jenkins: go to \"Manage Jenkins\" > \"Configure System\" > scroll down to section \"influxdb target\" maintain Influx data Jenkins as a Service For Jenkins as a Service instances this is already preset to the local InfluxDB with the name jenkins . In this case there is not need to do any additional configuration.

Therefore no need to go through the data source configuration step unless you want to add addtional data sources. Data collected in InfluxDB \u00b6 The Influx plugin collects following data in the Piper context: All data as per default InfluxDB plugin capabilities Additional data collected via commonPipelineEnvironment.setInfluxCustomDataProperty() and via commonPipelineEnvironment.setPipelineMeasurement() Add custom information to your InfluxDB You can simply add custom data collected during your pipeline runs via available data objects. Example: //add data to measurement jenkins_custom_data - value can be a String or a Number commonPipelineEnvironment . setInfluxCustomDataProperty ( 'myProperty' , 2018 ) Collected InfluxDB measurements \u00b6 Measurements are potentially pre-fixed - see parameter influxPrefix above.

UIVeri5 describes following benefits on its GitHub page: Automatic synchronization with UI5 app rendering so there is no need to add waits and sleeps to your test. Tests are reliable by design. Tests are written in synchronous manner, no callbacks, no promise chaining so are really simple to write and maintain. Full power of webdriverjs, protractor and jasmine - deferred selectors, custom matchers, custom locators. Control locators (OPA5 declarative matchers) allow locating and interacting with UI5 controls. Does not depend on testability support in applications - works with autorefreshing views, resizing elements, animated transitions. Declarative authentications - authentication flow over OAuth2 providers, etc. Console operation, CI ready, fully configurable, no need for java (comming soon) or IDE. Covers full ui5 browser matrix - Chrome,Firefox,IE,Edge,Safari,iOS,Android. Open-source, modify to suite your specific neeeds. Browser Matrix With this step and the underlying Docker image ( selenium/standalone-chrome ) only Chrome tests are possible. Testing of further browsers can be done with using a custom Docker image.

If empty, Docker is not used and the command is executed directly on the Jenkins system. dockerWorkspace - Only relevant for Kubernetes case: Specifies a dedicated user home directory for the container which will be passed as value for environment variable HOME . failOnError - With failOnError the behavior in case tests fail can be defined. gitBranch - In case a testRepository is provided the branch in this repository can be specified with gitBranch . gitSshKeyCredentialsId - In case a testRepository is provided and it is protected, access credentials (as Jenkins credentials) can be provided with gitSshKeyCredentialsId . Note: In case of using a protected repository, testRepository should include the ssh link to the repository. installCommand - The command that is executed to install the test tool. runCommand - The command that is executed to start the tests. script - The common script environment of the Jenkinsfile running. Typically the reference to the script calling the pipeline step is provided with the this parameter, as in script: this . This allows the function to access the commonPipelineEnvironment for retrieving, for example, configuration parameters. seleniumHost - The host of the selenium hub, this is set automatically to localhost in a Kubernetes environment (determined by the ON_K8S environment variable) of to selenium in any other case. The value is only needed for the runCommand . seleniumPort - The port of the selenium hub. The value is only needed for the runCommand . sidecarEnvVars - A map of environment variables to set in the sidecar container, similar to dockerEnvVars . sidecarImage - The name of the docker image of the sidecar container. If empty, no sidecar container is started. stashContent - If specific stashes should be considered for the tests, their names need to be passed via the parameter stashContent . testOptions - This allows to set specific options for the UIVeri5 execution. Details can be found in the UIVeri5 documentation . testRepository - With testRepository the tests can be loaded from another reposirory. testServerUrl - The testServerUrl is passed as environment variable TARGET_SERVER_URL to the test execution. The tests should read the host information from this environment variable in order to be infrastructure agnostic. Step configuration \u00b6 We recommend to define values of step parameters via config.yml file . In following sections of the config.yml the configuration is possible: parameter general step/stage dockerEnvVars X dockerImage X dockerWorkspace X failOnError X gitBranch X gitSshKeyCredentialsId X X installCommand X runCommand X script seleniumHost X seleniumPort X sidecarEnvVars X sidecarImage X stashContent X testOptions X testRepository X testServerUrl X Exceptions \u00b6 If you see an error like fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /home/jenkins) it is likely that your test description cannot be found.
